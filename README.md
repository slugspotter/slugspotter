- 👋 Hi, I’m @slugspotter, a self-taught Python developer of the worst kind.
- 👀 I’m interested in reporting a weird bug in Python 3.10.7 and suggesting an effective patch for it.
- 🌱 I’m currently developping a Python-Tkinter word processor (of all crazy projects!).
-     The latest version is a standalone executable sporting unique features like, for instance,
-     an integrated keyword-in-context (KWIC) multifile search engine.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with anybody with interests in documentary/text search. 
- 📫 How to reach me : mlibrt@yahoo.com
